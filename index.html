<h3>So what should you do not to go crazy?</h3>
<div>
<ol>
    <li> <b>Do sports</b>, your body needs regular exercise. Short walks from the refrigerator to the living room don't count. &#127947; </li>
    <li><b>Drink plenty of water.</b> If you think you are drinking enough water, you are not. Add at least one more glass to your daily routine. &#128167; </li>
    <li><b>Breathe some fresh air.</b> If you don't have a private garden or something, ventilate your apartment. &#127788;</li>
    <li><b>Work on relationships with your loved ones.</b> How long have you not talked to your parents, grandmother, uncle, cousin, or that sweet bakery lady? This may be the best time to call or write them to say: "Hi, I miss you." &#128149; </li>
    <li><b>Find your best way of meditation.</b> It may be listening to the sounds of the nature on Youtube or watching funny sitcoms on Netflix, knitting an eco-friendly shopper bag or building bridges from the chopsticks you get ordering asian food. &#129378; </li>
    <li><b>Play with your pet.</b> If you still don't have any, ask your friends to get you one! Maybe somewhere on the other side of the town a lovely cat, dog, owl, lobster, goldfish or tarantula is waiting to become you best friend. &#129417; </li>
</ol>
